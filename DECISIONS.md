# Decisions

## 001 — Local development first
Use Python 3.13, FastAPI and Next.js, with no external services in the foundation. Python 3.14 is installed but ML wheel support favors 3.13. Alternatives: container-only setup or mandatory PostgreSQL. Consequence: fewer initial dependencies; persistence and deployment arrive with concrete requirements.

## 002 — UI direction
Visual thesis: a quiet charcoal editing workspace with warm white typography and one lime accent. Content: library first, empty-state guidance, then upload/workspace as ingestion arrives. Interaction: focus feedback and short hover transitions, respecting reduced motion. No fabricated videos or search results.
